### Introduction
This document is a textual specification of the Ronion anonymous routing protocol framework.
The goal of this document is to give enough guidance to permit a complete and correct implementation of the protocol.

Refer to the design document if you need a high level overview of this framework.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in IETF [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

#### Glossary
* Initiator: the node that initiates communication
* Responder: the node with which initiator wants to communicate
* Routing path: a sequence of nodes that form a path through which initiator and responder are connected and can anonymously send encrypted data
* Routing path segment: part of routing path between 2 adjacent nodes, on each node routing path segment is identified using routing path segment identifier and address of the node on the other end of the segment
* Packet: set of bytes to be transferred from one node to another
* Application: software that uses implementation of this protocol

#### Numbers
All numbers are unsigned integers in big endian format.

#### Address
Address format is defined by application and MUST have constant length.

Address is typically either IP:port combination or public key of the node.

#### Re-wrapping
Re-wrapping a process of non-authenticated encryption or decryption. Wrapping or unwrapping is used depending on direction (from initiator to responder or backwards) and will be often called re-wrapping for simplicity.

When initiator sends encrypted data to the last node in routing path it wraps (encrypts without authentication) encrypted data multiple times and each node in routing path unwraps (decrypts without authentication) it before encrypted data reach responder. When some node sends data to initiator, it will wrap encrypted data, each node in the routing path will also wrap encrypted data and initiator will eventually unwrap data necessary number of times.

Re-wrapping doesn't have any integrity check (non-authenticated) and relies on end-to-end authenticated encryption. Re-wrapping doesn't affect data length. The only purpose of re-wrapping is to hide encrypted data from limited observer that controls more than 1 node on the routing path (re-wrapped data will look differently on each segment of the routing path).

#### Encryption
`{}` means data are encrypted (as the result of consuming `CREATE_REQUEST` and `CREATE_RESPONSE` and establishing corresponding encryption keys) and current node is capable of encrypting and/or decrypting it.
MAC is assumed to be present after encrypted data, but not shown explicitly.

NOTE: data are always wrapped at least once after encryption and need to be unwrapped before decryption!

#### Data structure notation
`[]` is used to specify a distinct piece of raw data (encrypted if placed under `{}`).
The size of the data piece is specified in bytes after colon like this: `[data: 2]`, if no size specified, then data occupies the rest of available space.
Exact value can be specified after data piece size separated by coma: `[data: 2, 1]`.

#### Packet format
```
[segment_id: 2][packet_data]
```

`[segment_id]` is unique to each segment of the network, the response MUST always preserve `[segment_id]` of the request so that it is clear where to send it further.

#### Packet size
Total packet size is fixed and configured by application, padding with random bytes is used when needed as described in corresponding sections.

It is responsibility of the application to carefully count how many bytes can be sent in each particular command type with selected encryption algorithm and make sure data will fit into one packet (or split data into multiple packets if needed).

#### [zero_bytes_padding]
Is added at the end of the command data when needed (so that all packets always have configured size).

#### Commands
Commands explain what node MUST do with the packet it has received, supported commands are listed below.

Each command is represented by number from the range `0..255`.
The list of supported commands is given below:

| Command name    | Numeric value |
|-----------------|---------------|
| CREATE_REQUEST  | 0             |
| CREATE_RESPONSE | 1             |
| EXTEND_REQUEST  | 2             |
| EXTEND_RESPONSE | 3             |

Numbers `5..9` are reserved for future versions of the specification, numbers `10..255` can be defined by application for its purposes.

### Routing path construction
Before routing path construction happens, application layer MUST select:
* authenticated encryption algorithm for end-to-end encryption
* non-authenticated encryption algorithm for re-wrapping
* a list of nodes (represented by their addresses) that will together form a routing path

Routing path construction is started by initiator with sending `CREATE_REQUEST` command(s) to the first node in routing path in order to create the first routing path segment and receives `CREATE_RESPONSE` command(s) back.

After last `CREATE_RESPONSE` received by initiator each side should have:
* A pair of re-wrapping ciphers with unique random initial data that will be used for messages re-wrapping
* A pair of unique objects for messages encryption and decryption

There will be 2 re-wrapping ciphers with their initial data and 2 encryption/decryption objects so that data can be sent by initiator and towards initiator independently (full-duplex).

Then initiator sends `EXTEND_REQUEST` command(s) to the first node in order to extend the routing path by one more segment to the second node and receives `EXTEND_RESPONSE` command(s) back.
Initiator keeps sending `EXTEND_REQUEST` commands to the last node in current routing path until last node in routing path is responder, at which point routing path is ready to send data back and forth.

`EXTEND_REQUEST` essentially encapsulates `CREATE_REQUEST` and `EXTEND_RESPONSE` encapsulates `CREATE_RESPONSE`, so eventually initiator will have unique pairs of ciphers for re-wrapping and encryption/decryption objects with each node in routing path.

### Routing path usage
When routing path is constructed, initiator can send data towards nodes in routing path and other nodes in routing path can send data towards initiator.

After encrypting data, sender applies re-wrapping using cipher for specific path direction (remember, we have 2 re-wrapping ciphers, one for each direction) and sends data to the next node in routing path.

When node receives encrypted data it applies re-wrapping to the data first, then tries to decrypt. If decryption fails - re-wrapped data are sent to the next node in routing path.

### Plain text commands
These commands are used prior to establishing routing path segments with specified `[segment_id]`, as soon as routing path segment is established plaintext commands MUST NOT be accepted.

#### CREATE_REQUEST
Is sent when creating segment of routing path is needed, can be sent multiple times to the same node if multiple roundtrips are needed.

Request data:
```
[command: 1, 1][segment_creation_request_data_length: 2][segment_creation_request_data][zero_bytes_padding]
```

Request data handling:
* `[segment_creation_request_data]` is consumed by the node in order to generate keys for routing path segment creation
* `[segment_id]` is linked by protocol implementation with address of the node where `CREATE_REQUEST` came from, together `[segment_id]` and node address uniquely identify routing path segment
* responds to the previous node with `CREATE_RESPONSE` command

#### CREATE_RESPONSE
Is sent as an answer to `CREATE_REQUEST`, is sent in response to each `CREATE_REQUEST`.

Response data:
```
[command: 1, 2][segment_creation_response_data_length: 2][segment_creation_response_data][zero_bytes_padding]
```

Response data handling:
* if current node has initiated `CREATE_REQUEST` then `[segment_creation_response_data]` is consumed by the node in order to perform routing path segment creation
* if current node has not initiated `CREATE_REQUEST`, but instead it `EXTEND_REQUEST` command was sent by another node, `EXTEND_RESPONSE` is generated in response

### Encrypted commands
These commands are used after establishing routing path segment with specified `[segment_id]` and corresponding node address.

Each encrypted command request data follows following pattern:
```
{[command: 1][command_data_length: 2][command_data][zero_bytes_padding]}
```

#### EXTEND_REQUEST command
Is used in order to extend routing path one segment further, effectively generates `CREATE_REQUEST` to the next node, can be sent multiple times to the same node if multiple roundtrips are needed.

If `[segment_id]` was previously extended to another node, further extension MUST be ignored.

Request data:
```
{[command: 1, 3][address_and_segment_creation_request_data_length: 2][next_node_address][segment_creation_request_data][zero_bytes_padding]}
```

Request data handling:
* decrypt command and command data length
* if command is `EXTEND_REQUEST` then send `CREATE_REQUEST` command with `[segment_creation_request_data]` command data to the `[next_node_address]` using newly generated `[segment_id]` for that segment
* `[segment_id]` of the previous node and `[segment_id]` of the next node MUST be linked together by protocol implementation for future data forwarding

`CREATE_REQUEST` request data being sent:
```
[command: 1, 1][segment_creation_request_data_length: 2][segment_creation_request_data][zero_bytes_padding]
```

#### EXTEND_RESPONSE command
Is used in order to extend routing path one segment further, effectively wraps `CREATE_RESPONSE` from next node and send it to the previous node, is sent in response to each `EXTEND_REQUEST`.

Response data:
```
{[command: 1, 4][segment_creation_response_data_length][segment_creation_response_data][zero_bytes_padding]}
```

Where `[segment_creation_response_data_length]` and `[segment_creation_response_data]` parts are taken from `CREATE_RESPONSE` data directly (which were sent in response to `CREATE_REQUEST`)`.

Response data handling:
* if `[segment_creation_response_data_length]` has value `0`, it means that routing path creation has failed (can happen if node can't extend the routing path, for instance, when node with specified address doesn't exist)

#### Data commands
Data commands can have any number from range of `10..255` and should be interpreted by application layer.
Is used to actually transfer useful data between applications on different nodes.

Data commands don't differentiate request from response, application layer SHOULD also take care of delivery confirmations if necessary, since this is not done by protocol either.

Data commands can be sent by:
* initiator towards any node in the routing path, including responder
* any node in the routing path, including responder, towards initiator

Request data:
```
{[command: 1][data_length: 2][data][zero_bytes_padding]}
```

#### Data forwarding
Only works after `EXTEND_REQUEST` and `EXTEND_RESPONSE` happened before, so that node knows where to send data next.

Forwarding is happening when node can't decrypt the command after re-wrapping, which in turn means that the command was not intended for this node.
Also all of the data moving in direction from responder to initiator SHOULD be forwarded without command decryption attempt, since they are always intended for initiator.

Initiator upon receiving the data tries to decrypt data with keys that correspond to each node in routing path until it decrypts data successfully.
The order in which keys are selected is up to the application or implementation, but starting from the keys of the first node in the routing path and moving to the last node is a good idea, since it simplifies implementation (as unwrapping needs to be done after each decryption trial and this way it is easier to keep consistent state in re-wrapping cipher).

#### Dropping packets
If packets were forwarded through the whole routing path and the last node (either initiator or responder) still can't decrypt the packet, the packet is silently dropped.
If packet is decrypted successfully, but command is unknown, the packet is silently dropped.
Undecryptable or packets with non-existing command (just to stop data from moving to the next node) can be used to generate fake activity.

### Acknowledgements
This protocol framework is heavily inspired by [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

The crypto layer for end-to-end encryption that was kept in mind throughout designing was `NK` handshake pattern from [The Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/).
